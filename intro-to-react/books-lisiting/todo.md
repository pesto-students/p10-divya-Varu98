4. Implement a higher-order component (HOC) called WithLogging.
- Create a higher-order component named WithLogging that wraps the BookList component.
- The WithLogging HOC should log a message to the console each time the BookList component is rendered.
- You can use the console.log() function to log the message.
- Apply the WithLogging HOC to the BookList component:
- Wrap the BookList component with the WithLogging HOC so that it logs a message on each render.

5. Test the application and observe the console logs:

- Run the React development server and verify that the book list is rendered correctly.
- Open the browser's console and observe the logged messages from the WithLogging HOC.

By completing these tasks, you will practice converting a function component to a class component, creating a functional component, converting a component to a pure component for performance optimization, and implementing a higher-order component for additional functionality. Test the application to ensure the book list is rendered correctly, and check the console logs to confirm that the WithLogging HOC is functioning as expected.

Note: Make sure to include relevant imports, utilize the appropriate React component lifecycle methods if needed, and structure your components in separate files for better organization. Submission Guidelines: Note: Ensure your code is well-structured, properly commented, and follows best practices for code quality and readability, including Redux-specific guidelines.
